Hello and welcome! Bem-vindo! Willkommen! Bienvenue!

I'm Benjamin, a software developer with experience in Data Science and business software 
in the energy industry. I also have a background in teaching and continuous learning, 
which has honed my ability to communicate complex concepts clearly.

My journey as a developer began with a thesis in Computational Physics, 
sparking my passion for data analysis and programming. 
Python is my preferred programming language and I like to visit Python conferences, 
user group meetings or barcamps.
Outside of work, I try to stay in shape and good mood doing cycling, hiking, reading and calisthenics. 
Fluent in German, English, and French. Currently love to learn and practise Brazilian Portuguese. 
I love travelling and warm weather. I constantly try to escape the German winter.

I created this site to get in touch and share thoughts directly. 
Soon it will give you an idea about my experience, past projects and interests.
You can also find me on LinkedIn, GitHub, and other major social media platforms. 

Feel free to reach out—I’d love to connect and share ideas!
